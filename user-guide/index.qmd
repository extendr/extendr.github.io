\~\~\~ THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!! \~\~\~
:::

This user guide serves two primary functions:

-   First, and more generally, it explains how to call Rust code in R (and, as
    it happens, how to call R code in Rust).
-   Second, and more narrowly, it provides sufficient information and resources
    to empower developers to build R packages with Rust extensions and publish
    them to CRAN.

Given these goals, the guide is primarily geared towards R users and R
developers who also have a decent grasp of Rust.

## What's in this guide?

We're working on that...

## What's *not* in this guide?

This book is not intended to be a comprehensive introduction to Rust. While do
go over some of the basics, more often than not, concepts are introduced only to
help explain extendr tools. That said, we do try to include copious references
and links to additional resources that the reader can follow to learn more about
specific topics. Of course, the biggest reference will be ["The
Book"](<https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/>).

This book is also not intended to be a comprehensive guide to R package
development! There are, quite frankly, better resources for that, notably [R
Packages (2e)](<https://r-pkgs.org/>). As with Rust specifics, we will strive
to point you in the right direction to get more details and advice when you need
it.
