title: Publishing to CRAN
---

extendr-based packges are CRAN compatible **out of the box**! You only have to do _one_ additional stepâ€”vendor your Rust dependencies. 

```r
rextendr::vendor_pkgs()
```

That's it!

## cran-comments.md

As with most things in life, communication is key. We recommend communicating thoroughly in your `cran-comments.md`. 

In some cases your R package's `.tar.gz` can be quite large due to the `vendor.tar.xz` file. In your `cran-comments.md` make a note of the size. For example write:

>  "Tarball is 4.7mb due to vendored rust depencies."

## MSRV

As of this writing the **MSRV of CRAN** is 1.81. In order to publish to CRAN, this MSRV must be met.

See [CRAN's MSRV](cran-msrv.qmd) for a detailed list of Rust versions for each check flavor.

## Nightly features

CRAN does not support nightly features as of this writing. Any package you plan to publish on CRAN cannot use nightly features. 

## Why vendor?

One of the reasons we love CRAN is that they take portability seriously. Because of this, an R package must contain everything it needs to build. This means that the Rust dependencies must not be downloaded as the package is installed. 

Vendoring is the process of embedding the source code of our dependencies into our R package. `vendor_pkgs()` creates a `vendor.tar.xz` file which contains the compressed source of all the dependencies.
