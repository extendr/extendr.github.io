## Objective
- Understand how to transform iterator values using `.map()`
- Learn how to use closures (anonymous functions) in Rust
- Collect iterator results back into a collection using `.collect()`
- Use turbofish 🐠💨 syntax for type annotations when needed
:::

Often we want to transform the values in a vector. To do this in Rust, we can use the `.map()` method. `.map()` lets us apply an operation on each element of the iterator.

In R, we often use the `purrr::map()` function or the `apply()` family of functions to do this.

## Using `.map()`

We apply `.map()` to an iterator. For example, to square each element in a vector we can write:

```rust
// providing explicit type annotation in one
// value so the compiler knows its f64 and not f32
let x = vec![5.9_f64, 6.8, 4.5, 7.3, 6.2];

x.iter().map(|xi| xi.powi(2))
```

Using `.map()` returns another iterator. We can chain operations over iterators by using multiple `.map()` statements.


## Closures

In the above example we used a **closure** to modify each element of the iterator. Closures are Rust's version of an anonymous function.

A closure takes the structure `|arg| expression`. They can also be multiple lines by wrapping the expression in a braces:

```rust
x
    .iter()
    .map(|xi| {
        let squared = xi.powi(2);
        xi.sqrt()
    })
```

Since iterators only contain one item, the closure only has one argument. However, you can use **destructuring** in the closure. For example if using `.enumerate()` we want to access `i` we can do so:

```rust
x
    .iter()
    .enumerate()
    .map(|(i, xi)| {
        // do stuff here
    })
```

## Collecting results

In R when we use `map()` the results are always returned as a vector. In Rust, we have to explcitly **collect** the iterator into our own type using `.collect()`.

Typically iterators are collected into a `Vec<T>`. Rust cant always infer the type that you want to collect into so we must tell the compiler what type we want.

We can do this during assignment:

```rust
let x_squared: Vec<f64> = x.iter().map(|xi| xi.powi(2)).collect();
```


## Turbofish 🐠💨

Alternatively, we can use "turbofish" syntax. We can specify the type directly in the `.collect()` function. `.collect()` is a **generic** method. And in the words of the Rust standard library documentation (emphasis mine)

> "Because `collect()` is so general, it **can cause problems with type inference**. As such, `collect()` is one of the few times you’ll see the syntax affectionately known as the ‘turbofish’: `::<>`. This helps the inference algorithm understand specifically which collection you’re trying to collect into."

Turbofish takes the structure of `.collect::<TYPE>()`.



### Examples

:::{layout-ncol="2"}
#### Explicit typing
```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];

    // Add 1 to each element
    let incremented: Vec<_> = nums.iter()
        .map(|x| x + 1)
        .collect();

    println!("{:?}", incremented);
}
```

#### Inference w/ turbofish
```rust
fn main() {
    let nums = vec![1, 2, 3];

    // Add 1 to each element
    let incremented = nums.iter()
        .map(|x| x + 1)
        .collect::<Vec<_>>();

    println!("{:?}", incremented);
}
```
:::

Turbofish is a bit more awkward at first, but it is more flexible and doesn't require modification whenever the inner type changes.

## Exercise 1

Calculate the **variance** of a slice of `f64` values.

$$
\text{variance} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n - 1}
$$

* Create a function `variance()` that:

  * Uses `.map()` to calculate squared differences from the mean
  * Uses `.sum()` to add them up
  * Divides by `n - 1`

::: callout-tip

* Use `.powi(2)` to square values.
* Use your previously defined `mean()` function inside `variance()`.

fn variance(x: &[f64]) -> f64 {
    let n = x.len() as f64;
    let avg = mean(x);
    let sq_diffs: f64 = x
        .iter()
        .map(|xi| ___ )  // squared difference here
        .__();           // sum method here

    sq_diffs / (n - 1.0)
}

```rust
fn variance(x: &[f64]) -> f64 {
    let n = x.len() as f64;
    let avg = mean(x);
    let sq_diffs: f64 = x
        .iter()
        .map(|xi| (xi - avg).powi(2))
        .sum();
    sq_diffs / (n - 1.0)
}

fn main() {
    let x = vec![2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0];
    println!("Variance is: {:.2}", variance(&x));
}
```

## Exercise 2

Create a function `standardize()` to perform z-score standardization on a vector of `f64`.

$$
z_i = \frac{x_i - \mu}{\sigma}
$$

* Use `.iter()` and `.map()` to calculate mean and variance.
* Use `.into_iter()`, `.map()`, and `.collect()` to build the standardized vector.
* Return a new `Vec<f64>` of standardized values.

```rust
fn standardize(x: &[f64]) -> Vec<f64> {
    let avg = mean(x);
    let std_dev = variance(x).sqrt();
    x.iter().map(|xi| (xi - avg) / std_dev).collect()
}

fn main() {
    let x = vec![1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0];
    let standardized = standardize(x);
    println!("Standardized: {:?}", standardized);
}
