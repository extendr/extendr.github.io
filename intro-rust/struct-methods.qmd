# Struct Methods

::: callout-tip
## Objectives

Learn how to implement methods for stucts. Be able to create associated functions and understand the difference between `Self`, `&self`, and `&mut self`


:::

## Associated Functions

Typically methods are used on instantiations of a variable such as:

```rust
let me = Person { name: "Josiah".to_string(), age: 29 };
let birth_year = me.year_of_birth();
```

Sometimes it makes sense to use an **associated function**. These are functions that are called from the type itself e.g. `Type::function()`. They're typically used for *constructors*. For example

```rust
let me = Person::new("Josiah".to_string(), 29);
```

They're created using an `impl` block.

## `impl`ement methods

`impl` is short for **implement**. We can implement methods for structs using the following syntax:

```rust
impl TypeName {
    fn method() {
        todo!()
    }
}
```

Associated functions are methods that do not reference the type itself. To create a `new()` constructor function that returns the type we can set the return type to `Self`:

```rust
impl Person {
    fn new(name: String, age: i32) -> Self {
        Person { name, age }
    }
}
```

This gives us the ability to use `Person::new()`

## Self references

However, it often makes sense to call methods _from_ an instantiation itself.

We can do this by setting the first argument to `&self` which provides a **reference** to the struct the method is called on.

```rust
impl Person {
    fn greet(&self) {
        println!("Hello, my name is {} and I am {} years old.", self.name, self.age);
    }
}
```

Using a `&self` reference means you cannot _move_ the inner fields, only borrow them.


We can also have arguments that refer to other instantiations of the same type via `&Self` or `Self`. For example to compare ages of people:

```rust
impl Person {
    fn is_older_than(&self, other_person: &Self) -> bool {
        self.age > other_person.age
    }
}
```

## Mutable self

Often it makes sense to modify the fields of a struct. This is when a _mutable reference_ is handy via `&mut self`.

For example we can implement methods to `rename()` and `celebrate_birthday()`:

```rust
impl Person {
    fn rename(&mut self, new_name: &str) {
        self.name = new_name.to_string();
    }

    fn celebrate_birthday(&mut self) {
        self.age += 1;
    }
}
```

## Section 2

## Another Section

## Exercise

- Implement a `Point::new()` associated function
  - Using arguments `x: f64` and `y: f64`
  - It should return `Self`
- Define a method `euclidean_distance()` which calculates the distance between itself and another `Point`
  - Use arguments `&self` and `destination: &Self`
  - Return `f64`
  - Distance is calculated as $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$
  - Use `.powi(2)` to square a value and `x.sqrt()` to get the square root
- In `main.rs` create two `Point` structs and calculate the distance between them.

```rust
impl Point {
    fn new(x: f64, y: f64) -> Self {
        Self { x, y }
    }

    fn euclidean_distance(&self, destination: &Self) -> f64 {
        let x_diff = (self.x - destination.x).powi(2);
        let y_diff = (self.y - destination.y).powi(2);

        (x_diff + y_diff).sqrt()
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = Point::new(0.0, 5.0);
    let b = Point::new(-10.0, 1.5);
    let distance = a.euclidean_distance(&b);
    println!("Distance between a and b is {distance}");
}
```

## Bonus: Exercise 2


Euclidean distance is useful only on a rectangle. What about on a sphere? Haversine distance is used to calculate the distance on a sphere. The Haversine formula computes the distance between two points on a sphere given their longitudes and latitudes.

It is defined by the following (messy) equation:


$$a = \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\phi}{2}\right) + \cos\phi_1 \cdot \cos\phi_2 \cdot \sin^2\left(\frac{\Delta\lambda}{2}\right)$$

$$c = 2 \cdot \text{atan2}(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{1-a})$$

$$d = R \cdot c$$

Where:

- $\phi$ represents latitude (in radians) (use `.to_radians()`)
- $\lambda$ represents longitude (in radians) (use `.to_radians()`)
- $R$ is the Earth's radius (you can use `6_371_008_7714f64` meters as a mean radius)
- $\Delta\phi$ is the difference in latitude between the two points ($\phi_2 - \phi_1$)
- $\Delta\lambda$ is the difference in longitude between the two points ($\lambda_2 - \lambda_1$)
* $\text{atan2}(y, x)$ is the **arctangent** of $y/x$, using the signs of both arguments to determine the correct quadrant.


**Hints for Implementation:**

* Remember to convert your latitude and longitude values from degrees to **radians** using the `.to_radians()` method on `f64`.
* The `c` part of the formula, $2 \cdot \text{atan2}(\sqrt{a}, \sqrt{1-a})$, can also be implemented using `2 * a.sqrt().asin()` in Rust, which is a common simplification when `a` is within the valid domain for `asin`.

```rust
impl Point {
    fn haversine_distance(&self, destination: &Self) -> f64 {
        let radius = 6_371_008.7714; // Earth's mean radius in meters
        let theta1 = self.y.to_radians(); // Latitude of point 1
        let theta2 = destination.y.to_radians(); // Latitude of point 2
        let delta_theta = (destination.y - self.y).to_radians(); // Delta Latitude
        let delta_lambda = (destination.x - self.x).to_radians(); // Delta Longitude

        let a = (delta_theta / 2f64).sin().powi(2)
            + theta1.cos() * theta2.cos() * (delta_lambda / 2f64).sin().powi(2);

        2f64 * a.sqrt().asin() * radius
    }
}
