# Mutable Vectors

::: callout-tip
## Objective
Learn how to create and modify vectors with mutable operations.
:::

In Rust, vectors (`Vec<T>`) are growable arrays. To modify a vector after creating it, the vector itself must be declared as `mut`.

::: callout-note
You will often see `<T>` in Rust code or documentation. `T` is a way of saying "of any type." Seeing `Vec<T>` can be read as "a vector of any type" or "generic over type `T`."

### Creating empty vectors

You can create an empty vector and let Rust infer the type based on usage:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut names = Vec::new();
    names.push("Alice");
    names.push("Bob");
    println!("{:?}", names);
}
```

- `Vec::new()` creates an empty vector.
- `.push()` adds an element to the end of a vector.

### Clearing vectors

You can remove all elements from a vector using `.clear()`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut nums = vec![1, 2, 3];
    nums.clear();
    println!("{:?}", nums); // prints []
}
```

### Sorting vectors

Use `.sort()` to sort a vector. Important to note that not all types can be sorted.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = vec![11, 3, 7, 10, 1];
    println!("x before sorting: {x:?}");
    x.sort();
    println!("x after sorting:  {x:?}");
}
```
```
x before sorting: [11, 3, 7, 10, 1]
x after sorting:  [1, 3, 7, 10, 11]
```

### Combining vectors

Use `.extend()` to append one vector's contents to another:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut a = vec![1, 2];
    let b = vec![3, 4];
    // note that we don't assign.
    // Instead, `a` is modified in place
    a.extend(b);
    println!("{:?}", a); // prints [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

- `.extend()` adds the contents of another vector.
- The original vector must be `mut`.
- The second vector is **moved** into the first.
- `b` can no longer be used.

## Exercise

- Create an empty vector
- Append the values `1.0`, `2.0`, and `3.0` using `.push()`
- Clear the vector to make it empty
- Lastly, extend it with another vector e.g. `[4.0, 5.0]`
- Sort the vector
- Print the final result.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = Vec::new();
    x.push(1.0);
    x.push(2.0);
    x.push(3.0);
    x.clear();
    x.extend(vec![4.0, 5.0]);
    println!("{:?}", x);
}
```
