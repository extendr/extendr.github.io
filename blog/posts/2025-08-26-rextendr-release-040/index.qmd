## TL; DR

- New domain! Say hi to extendr.rs üëãüèº
- [Positron & VS Code Support üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª](#positron)
- [CRAN compatibility out of the box](#cran)
- [WebR support üï∏Ô∏è](#webr)

The extendr team is excited to announce the release of
[rextendr](https://extendr.github.io/rextendr/dev) `0.4`, along with two
follow-up patch releases, that bring significant improvements to the R package
ecosystem for Rust integration. These include:

- enhanced CRAN compatibility,
- improved developer experience,
- WebR support,
- and streamlined package scaffolding.

A great deal of work also went into re-factoring code to reduce package dependencies and 
improve the maintainability to ensure the long-term viability of the project.

::: callout-note
## What is rextendr?

For those new to the project, rextendr is an R package similar to `usethis` and
`devtools` for supporting development of Rust-powered R packages, with the Rust
crate `extendr` handling most of the heavy lifting behind the scenes.
:::

## WebR support{#webr}

A very exciting development in this release is **WebR compatibility out of the box**. All extendr-powered R packages are now compatible with [WebR](https://webr.r-wasm.org/latest/), meaning your packages can run in the browser without an R installation. 

WebR support happens without any additional work on your part. Just update your build files with `use_extendr()` and permit rextendr to update your `Makevars{.win}.in`, files in `tools/`, `configure` scripts.

::: callout-tip
## WebR for existing packages
WebR support requires that `lto = true` in your release profile. This is handled for new packages, but not existing ones. Be sure to add it to your `Cargo.toml`.
:::


## CRAN compatibility{#cran}

The standout feature of the current release is found in rextendr's workhorse function `use_extendr()`, which now provides **CRAN-ready scaffolding out of the box**. All you need to do is vendor your Rust dependencies with `vendor_pkgs()` and you're ready for CRAN submission.


## Positron & VS Code Support{#positron}

With [Positron](http://positron.posit.co/) coming out of beta, we've introduced `use_positron()` and `use_vscode()` to generate (or update) `.vscode/settings.json` tailored to Rust development in R packages.

When you run `use_extendr()`, it now automatically calls `use_vscode()` when VS Code or Positron is detected as your IDE, making the setup completely seamless.

## Enhanced Developer Tools

Release of 0.4.0 and its patches also comes with additional developer tooling:

-   **Rust diagnostics**‚Äî`rust_sitrep()` provides comprehensive Rust toolchain diagnostics and guides you through fixing any installation issues
-   **Dependency management**‚Äî`use_crate()` makes adding Rust dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` as easy as `usethis::use_package()`
-   **MSRV support**‚Äî`use_msrv()` helps specify the minimum supported Rust version for your package
-   **Metadata access**‚Äî`read_cargo_metadata()` lets you fetch detailed project information from Cargo
-   **Eeasy dependency vendoring**‚Äî`vendor_pkgs()` vendors and compresses your Rust dependencies for easy CRAN publication and offline installation

## A new extendr badge! {#badge}

The extendr community has grown quite a bit in the last two years, maybe as much
as the codebase! First of all, we want to say **thank you** for being a part of the community!

We wanted to make sure that new developers could boast about
their extendr-powered packages‚Äîand, if we're being honest, increase visibility
for the project‚Äîby adding an extendr badge to their README files, which can
now be done with `use_extendr_badge()`. This results in:

[![](https://img.shields.io/badge/extendr-%5E0.8.0-276DC2)](https://extendr.rs/extendr/extendr_api/)

If you're using extendr in your package, do us a solid and add the badge to your README! ü•∫
