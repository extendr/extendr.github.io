Made use ndarray optional. Made #[extendr] calls panic thread safe. Added NA handling #[extendr] macro. Added separate extendr-engine crate needed calling R Rust. Wrapper classes pairlists, environment, raw, symbols others. iterator support. Operators index, slice, dollar, double_colon, +, -, * /`. Debug printing support expanded use wrappers. Conversion Robj wrapper types. Multithreaded support - allows multithreaded testing using recursive spinlock. Bool type extended implemented using TRUE, FALSE NA_BOOLEAN. Optional parameters support NA handing. Errors thrown input parameters without Option NA. Harmonising function names integer, real, logical, symbol, raw, list, pairlist env. Refactored robj code several source files. Many functions updated use generic types. R! macro executing R source code. call! macro call R code. sym! macro generate symbols. Simplification vector generation using collect_robj ToVectorValue. Added array types [1, 2, 3] Robj::targets.
